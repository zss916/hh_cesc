            <p>When you visit our site, we may automatically collect some information, such as the site from which you linked to us, the time and date of your visit, purchases, and activities. We also collect information received from third parties to the extent that they have represented that they have entered into an agreement with you for the connectivity of CESC Energy products to our monitoring platform and APP. CESC Energy does not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16, and you must be at least 17 years old to establish an account on the Site.</p>
            <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
            <p>The Personal Information we collect is used to process your requests or transactions, provide you high-quality service, customize the site according to your preferences, and inform you about specific goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive promotional information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know.

            <p>We may disclose Personal Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process or contractual necessity, respond to any claims, or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of CESC Energy, our customers, or the public. Information about our customers, including Personal Information, may be disclosed if it is necessary for legitimate purposes, such as part of, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition.

            <h3>Protection of Personal Information</h3>

            <h3>Aggregate Information</h3>
            <p>Personal information does not include “aggregate” information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, services, or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed, and a specific person cannot be identified through such information. Aggregate information is also any information or data we collect from inverters and power optimizers, which are available to you via the CESC Energy monitoring platform or APP. In other words, information about how you use a service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the same service, but no Personal Information will be included in the resulting data.</p>
